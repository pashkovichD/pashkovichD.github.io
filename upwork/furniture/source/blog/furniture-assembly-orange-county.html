						<h3 class="description__data-title"><svg width="200" height="82"><use xlink:href="#icon-dots"></use></svg>Think Before Buying</h3>
						<p class="description__data-text">The first step is to consider the assembly process of the furniture that you are about to buy. The rule here is to read the testimonials and online reviews of the furniture product before you buy it. With this, you will get a better idea of the installation process.</p>
						<p class="description__data-text">What this means is that there will be no surprises once the boxes arrive. Looking for pieces that are partially assembled will make the work easier. There are times when you will only be attaching two to three parts. Therefore, you will spend less on the furniture assembly Orange County experts.</p>
						<p class="description__data-text">There are some parts that will only attach with one screw. Therefore, it will take you a few minutes to assemble each furniture piece. The good thing about Los Angeles Furniture Installation is that we will serve you regardless of the complexity of the project.</p>

						<h3 class="description__data-title"><svg width="200" height="82"><use xlink:href="#icon-dots"></use></svg>Be Realistic</h3>
						<p class="description__data-text">It is good to leave the assembly of some items to professionals. There is no way you will install an upholstered bed frame unless you have the right skills and tools. You need to stretch over the upholstery and then attach it to wooden frames.</p>
						<p class="description__data-text">These frames have inbuilt connection points that are obscured, blocked, or misaligned by the upholstery. The other pieces that can be quite purchasing are the dressers. It is difficult to assemble this furniture and the process is a tedious one.</p>
						<p class="description__data-text">A full six-drawer dresser can have up to 300 components and pieces. There is no way you will fit them accordingly unless you are an expert. In most cases, you will need to assemble each drawer separately and then align it to a larger piece.</p>

						<h3 class="description__data-title"><svg width="200" height="82"><use xlink:href="#icon-dots"></use></svg>Assemble in the Correct Location</h3>
						<p class="description__data-text">It can be tempting to assemble your office desk in the living room. However, it is always good to think twice before you make such a move.</p>
						<p class="description__data-text">Expert furniture assembly Los Angeles recommends that you assemble the furniture piece in the room where you will be using it. This tip is more applicable to the heavy furniture pieces. In addition to being painful to move, you can scratch the floors and walls as you try to move the furniture.</p>

						<p class="description__data-subtitle">Carefully Open the Box</p>
						<p class="description__data-text">This is one of our areas of specialization as a furniture installation company in Orange County. We try all that we can to avoid damaging your floors or furniture even before we start.</p>
						<p class="description__data-text">You need to open the box cautiously because box cutters and scissors are damaging. The box can help you to protect the floor as you continue to build.</p>

						<p class="description__data-subtitle">Read All the Instructions</p>
						<p class="description__data-text">Even though we are well trained and skilled, we still read all the furniture assembly instructions before anything else. It is always wise to read the instructions and read them again.</p>
						<p class="description__data-text">It helps the professional furniture assembly experts to understand the whole process before embarking on it. This tells you why you need to re-check the installation instructions from time to time.</p>

						<p class="description__data-subtitle">Prepare for Success</p>
						<p class="description__data-text">Once you unpack everything carefully, you need to identify all the components. Group together the similar items and then lay them out in order. Drill professional furniture assembly experts often store small hardware pieces such as bolts and nuts in plastic cups so that they don’t get mixed up or roll away.</p>
						<p class="description__data-text">You also need to consider the right orientation of all the involved components; back, front, right, left, down, and up. In most cases, the finished edges face front or up. The mirror images are usually on the right and left sides while the finished surfaces face up or out.</p>
						<p class="description__data-text">Some components look alike but they are really not. You need to look for variations in quantity and hole-spacing. Experts look for any arrows and check the installation instructions. Both of them indicate the correct position that a component should be in to be sure of proper assembly.</p>
						<p class="description__data-text">You have to make sure that you are assembling all the parts in the right order. When you do otherwise, there is a high possibility that it will result into mistakes.</p>
