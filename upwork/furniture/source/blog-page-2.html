				<p class="promo__text">Have you ever visited a dentist or doctor? It is normal to assume that the health professional has met all the requirements that are mandated by the profession. These include registration, experience, licensing, and training to name a few. However, the case is different when it comes to hiring Los Angeles furniture installation experts.</p>
				<p class="promo__text">Some furniture installation companies in Los Angeles claim to have the right professionals on their crew when this is not the case. That is why you need to do your homework well and make sure that you are getting the best furniture installation company near me.</p>
				<p class="promo__text">This tells you why you need to do your homework well before you choose a furniture installer in California. Over the years, there have been a countless number of horror stories from the so-called professional furniture installers.</p>
				<p class="promo__text">Some of them will destroy or damage your valuables, show up late or even not turn up at all, engage in fights and conflicts with customers, pull a “bait and switch” in their billing, and refuse to install your furniture unless you pay higher fees. All these are things that you will not want to come your way.</p>
				<p class="promo__text">That is why you need to be extremely careful when looking for Los Angeles furniture installers. It is the only way that you can protect your budget, business, and get the peace of mind that you deserve the most. Here are some of the essentials that you need to pay close attention to when shopping for a furniture installer in Los Angeles.</p>

				<h2 class="visually-hidden">Pluses company</h2>
				<ul class="plus__list plus__list--3">
					<li class="plus__item">
						<h3 class="plus__title">Experience</h3>
						<p class="plus__text">When looking for furniture installers, you need to understand that experience has no substitute whatsoever. It is not sufficient to merely be able to put various furniture pieces together.</p>
						<p class="plus__text">The process of installing furniture is a complex and sophisticated one. Therefore, it requires a high level of expertise with power tools and hand tools. You also need someone who has the competence of working with various lines and types of furniture.</p>
						<p class="plus__text">Therefore, always look at the number of years that the furniture installer has been practicing in the industry. 	The other thing that you need to pay close attention to is the actual project that the installer has been working on.</p>
						<p class="plus__text">You don’t want someone who will be learning what to do on the job site. Look for people who have a rich experience of working with your furniture type. It is the only way that you will be sure of getting the best outcome from your project.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="plus__item">
						<h3 class="plus__title">Certification</h3>
						<p class="plus__text">There are some furniture installers who will tell you that certification does not apply to this industry. If you come across such a person, make sure that you avoid him or her by all means.</p>
						<p class="plus__text">The best furniture installation near me will send its team to be part of the furniture manufacturing training programs. This is what helps them to get certification of particular lines. Certification also helps installers to learn everything from moving, handling and even advanced installation applications.</p>
						<p class="plus__text">Therefore, any professional furniture installer will be able to handle all your moving needs. The best furniture installation company will also have its own in-house training program. The installers must achieve the required certification before they become part of the furniture installation project team.</p>
						<p class="plus__text">The best Los Angeles furniture installation company will screen through its employees to make sure that it is getting the best. As a customer, always request for a proof of these certifications. It is the only way that you will be sure that you have qualified professionals installing your furniture. The worst thing that you can do is to entrust your project in the hands of uncertified professionals.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="plus__item">
						<h3 class="plus__title">Insurance</h3>
						<p class="plus__text">Most people overlook the issue of insurance when looking for furniture installers. In real sense, it is one of the things that should in fact come at the top of these furniture installation essentials. It is very dangerous to employ furniture installers who are not certified to work on your project.</p>
						<p class="plus__text">Therefore, only use a furniture installation company that carries adequate insurance for its workers. The insurance could have expired yet the company is still in business. The best thing you can do is to request for a proof of insurance.</p>
						<p class="plus__text">Even though you don’t hope to raise an insurance claim, it is a necessity that you really need. If an injury or accident occurs, you will be liable to pay if the company does not cover its employees.</p>
						<p class="plus__text">The amount paid for lost wages and medical expenses can be so high for an ordinary citizen to afford. That is why you need to cushion yourself against such risks. Just make sure that you do everything right from the onset. </p>
					</li>
					<li class="plus__item">
						<h3 class="plus__title">Professionalism</h3>
						<p class="plus__text">Office furniture installation isn’t something that you can dabble in as an individual or company. This is a specialization that requires a high level of professionalism all the time.</p>
						<p class="plus__text">The furniture installers have to demonstrate through professional grade communication and project management. They should be able to provide you with references, project management and case studies.</p>
						<p class="plus__text">These experts should also commit to writing to make sure that they complete the punch list. They should also broom clean all the areas before the project is dome and the installers leave the premise. Professionalism is one of the things that will make sure that you get a high level of satisfaction.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="plus__item">
						<h3 class="plus__title">Safety</h3>
						<p class="plus__text">Safety is something that should be at the top of the mind of your furniture installer. Make sure that there are no forms of compromises whatsoever to this commitment.</p>
						<p class="plus__text">If you suspect that these are people who will cut some corners while working, avoid them as this will save you a lot of money and time in the long run. There are some unmistakable and clear signs that you should walk away. Use your instincts to make sure that you are making the right decision.</p>
