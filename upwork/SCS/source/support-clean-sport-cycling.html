				<p class="cycling__text">2016 was big for Support Clean Sport! Last year, we sponsored two cycling teams, the 706 Project Cycling Team and the Guttenplan Coaching Domestic Elite Cycling Team. Both teams had an amazing 2016 season.</p>
				<p class="cycling__text">In 2016, the 706 Project Men’s team did well in both the road and cyclocross disciplines. Frank Travieso was awarded the Georgia State Champion in both the Criterium and Cyclocross circuit. Dylan Cantrell and Gabriel Mendez, two members of the junior team, were both awarded State Criterium championship jerseys. The rest of the men’s squad including Emile Abraham, Andy Scarano, and Willem Kaiser, covered podiums all over the southeast consistently. Willem was also awarded the bronze medal at US Collegiate Road Race National Championships representing the University of Georgia. 706’s own Frank Travieso was featured in the July issue of Bicycling Magazine as one of “The New Heroes of Cycling.”</p>
				<p class="cycling__text">Last year, the 706 Project added an elite women’s off-road cycling team: the 706pChicks. These women had a successful 2016 season in the mountain bike, endurance, downhill, and cyclocross disciplines. Maria Carrelli won the Overall Georgia Cyclocross series and Terri Watts won the overall southeast 3rd Coast Enduro series. Terri Watts and Emily Cox claimed several enduro mountain bike podiums while Maria Carrelli and Leigh Hopkins claimed cyclocross podiums for their teams. Maria Carrelli also earned a bronze medal at the USA Cycling Marathon Mountain Bike Nationals.</p>
				<p class="cycling__text cycling__text--mb20">Both the men and women’s teams have been busy as ambassadors of the sport. The 706 team has hosted several women’s only group mountain bike rides, hosted several free clinics on strength and mobility, and mentored as well as supported up-and-coming athletes in the Georgia Interscholastic Cycling League. Both teams have also made several school visits to educate kids on helmet safety, assisted wounded veterans in the Ride2Recovery ride from Atlanta to New Orleans, collaborated with junior development cycling teams in order to provide a venue for advancement for their talented athletes, and participated in several other community events and health fairs.</p>

				<p class="cycling__text">Our title sponsorship team really pushed themselves to the clean sport limit last year. Several of our cyclists on the Guttenplan Coaching team were tested by USADA and received word that no prohibited substances or methods were found in their systems! We could not be prouder of these guys for working to Stay Clean and Win Clean.</p>
				<p class="cycling__text">With the Guttenplan team being in their fourth year of competition, they have over 60 wins and over 100 podiums. In 2016, they were able to claim their spot as the number one team in Florida and are looking to do even more this season. As we cannot list them all, here are some of the highlights from last year.</p>
				<p class="cycling__text">Jonathan Freter, a third year pro, claimed 10th overall at Cascade Cycling Championship last year. Coulton Hartrich won the Northstar Grand Prix best amateur jersey twice and came in 10th and then 6th overall. He also came in 6th overall in the 2016 UCI 2.2 8 stage at the Vuelta Independencia Nacional Republica Dominicana and 8th overall at the San Dimas Stage Race. Scotty Weiss is the WORLD MASTERS 2016 Road Champion, former longtime pro and elite national champion. Michael Stoop won 2nd in the 2016 Wilmington Grand Prix PRT for the Guttenplan team.</p>
				<p class="cycling__text">While rewarding for our teams, 2016 also taught us a lot about the dangers and risks associated with cycling. Our very own David Guttenplan was involved in an accident in which a vehicle hit him as he was riding his bicycle. He ended up in the hospital, undergoing many surgeries and recovering for most of last year, but he came back and raced in the fall to prove to all of us that anything is possible! It was amazing to watch David work through his recovery, without the aid of prohibited substances for advantage or pain relief, and fight to rehabilitate himself, get back in the saddle, and race again. Way to go, David!</p>
				<p class="cycling__text">It has been amazing to see the 706 and Guttenplan Coaching teams working to Support Clean Sport and get on the podium while doing so. We cannot wait to support them during the 2017 season and see what else than can do out there on the roads!</p>
				<p class="cycling__text">Support Clean Sport launched an Instagram account to further promote our mission to create a community environment where athletes, coaches, doctors, the nutrition industry, drug-testing professionals, brand partners and the public can come together to demonstrate, teach and foster a culture of clean sport that enables Real Athletes to win by dedication to proper training, nutrition and hard work. You can find our new social media account @SupportCleanSport.</p>
				<p class="cycling__text cycling__text--before-title">The Support Clean Sport program and mission are growing quickly. If you haven’t already, please join us in fighting for clean sport in 2017. Take the pledge today!</p>

				<p class="cycling__title">Support Clean Sport Cycling Hits the Road in 2016</p>
				<p class="cycling__text">Anti-Doping Research is pleased to announce the embodiment of our Support Clean Sport (SCS) campaign with the formation of Support Clean Sport Cycling.  We are excited to be joined by Banned Substances Control Group (BSCG) to support two teams for the 2016 Cycling season who will help us represent and grow Support Clean Sport.  Our message is simple: Be a Real Athlete!</p>
				<p class="cycling__text">Support Clean Sport will be the title sponsor of the Support Clean Sport – Sea Sucker – Guttenplan Coaching team and a supporting sponsor of the 706P development squad.  We are pleased to have the backing of BSCG in fostering Support Clean Sport and our cycling focus.  The BSCG Certified Drug Free supplement certification program helps athletes find drug free nutrition products.  The SCS and BSCG Certified Drug Free brands will be hitting the roads soon at a cycling race near you.</p>
				<p class="cycling__text">Building and growing the concept of clean sport begins with forming a community and culture that embraces the concept. We are thankful for our two cycling teams that are part of our growing community and understand that athletes stand a better chance of long term success by focusing on proper training, nutrition, and dedication to their sport. While performance enhancing drugs appear to be an easy avenue to success, they simply mar the athlete whether the doping is discovered or not.  If you win with performance enhancing drugs, you never really get the personal satisfaction of knowing that it was you, rather than the drugs, that beat the rest.  Isn’t that the point of being a real athlete?</p>
				<p class="cycling__text">Clean sport is the only real sport!  That is what Support Clean Sport is all about and what our two cycling teams embody.  To be a Real Athlete means to win by dedication to proper training, nutrition and hard work.  That is what our Support Clean Sport Cyclingg teams intend to do! Are you a Real Athlete?</p>
				<p class="cycling__text cycling__text--before-title">Support Clean Sport Cycling will see you on the podium, and we are going to be on top.  More importantly, we are going to get there without performance enhancing drugs.  Please help us to Support Clean Sport and our Cycling program and teams as we ride to for real athletes everywhere.</p>
